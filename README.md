# Monash AIM On-Boarding Resources
These are a set of on-boarding resources made for teaching new Monash AIM members about machine learning and neural networks. It is the goal of these to provide a fairly extensive education on the software the team uses, machine learning concepts, neural networks, and medical imaging. These are only a part of the on-boarding with companion pieces including slides, coding exercises and more.

List of notebooks:
- Notebook 0 - Software
- Notebook 1 - Machine Learning and Preface
- Notebook 2 - Neural Networks
- Notebook 3 - Convolutional Neural Networks
- Notebook 4 - Medical Imaging

We have eventual plans on expanding to more complex learning models.
- Notebook 5 - Deep Learning and Pre-trained Models
- Notebook 6 - Miscellaneous Models

In addition to notebooks we also have a set of coding exercises located in the `coding-exercises/` directory. These will be used to test members knowledge of concepts found within the notebooks and slides.
